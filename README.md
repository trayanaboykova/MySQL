<b> Course Curriculum: [MySQL Course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/4365/mysql-january-2024) </b>

**[Databases Introduction. Data Definition and Datatypes](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/MySQL/tree/main/MYSQL/Lesson01_DataDefinitionAndDatatypes)**: In this part of the lecture, I've learned the foundational concepts of databases, focusing on data definition and data types. I've delved into the usage of Structured Query Language (SQL) as a powerful tool for managing databases, mastering basic SQL queries for various data operations. Understanding the nuances of data types in MySQL Server has been pivotal, allowing me to effectively manage and organize data within database tables. Furthermore, I've explored data management techniques and the customization of tables to suit specific needs, laying a strong foundation for proficient database handling in real-world applications.

**[Basic CRUD](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/MySQL/tree/main/MYSQL/Lesson02_BasicCRUD)**: In this segment of the course, I delved into the fundamental operations of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) in database management. I grasped the essentials of query basics, enabling me to retrieve data from databases efficiently. Additionally, I learned how to insert new data into database tables effectively and modify existing records as needed. Mastering these CRUD operations has equipped me with the essential skills to interact with databases, empowering me to manage data seamlessly in various applications.

**[Built-in Functions](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/MySQL/tree/main/MYSQL/Lesson03_BuiltInFunctions)**: In this section, I explored the built-in functions available in MySQL Server, which are essential for efficient data manipulation. I learned about various categories of functions, including string functions for text manipulation, arithmetical operators, and numeric functions for mathematical operations, date functions for managing date and time data, and wildcards for flexible pattern matching in queries. By mastering these built-in functions, I gained the ability to perform a wide range of data operations effectively, enhancing my proficiency in database management and query execution.

**[Data Aggregation](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/MySQL/tree/main/MYSQL/Lesson04_DataAggregation)**: In this segment, I delved into the concept of data aggregation, a crucial aspect of database management. I learned about grouping, which involves consolidating data based on specific criteria, allowing for organized analysis and reporting. Additionally, I explored various aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN, and AVG, which are instrumental in performing calculations on grouped data sets. Furthermore, I gained proficiency in using the HAVING clause, enabling me to apply predicates while grouping data, facilitating more nuanced and targeted analysis. This understanding of data aggregation equips me with the skills to extract valuable insights from large datasets effectively.

**[Table Relations](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/MySQL/tree/main/MYSQL/Lesson05_TableRelations)**: In this section, I delved into the intricate world of table relations within databases, a critical aspect of database design and management. I learned about the principles of database design, emphasizing the importance of structuring data effectively for optimal performance and scalability. Understanding table relations allowed me to establish meaningful connections between different tables, enabling the retrieval of related data through queries. Additionally, I explored cascade operations, which ensure data integrity by automatically propagating changes across related tables. Furthermore, I gained proficiency in creating Entity-Relationship (E/R) diagrams, providing visual representations of the database schema and its relationships. This comprehensive understanding of table relations empowers me to design robust and efficient databases capable of handling complex data relationships effectively.

**[Subqueries and JOINs](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/MySQL/tree/main/MYSQL/Lesson06_SubqueriesAndJoins)**: In this module, I delved into the advanced techniques of subqueries and JOINs, which are essential for retrieving and manipulating data from multiple tables in databases. I learned about different types of JOINs, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, enabling me to gather data from multiple related tables efficiently. Additionally, I explored the power of subqueries, allowing for query manipulation on multiple levels, enhancing the flexibility and depth of data analysis. Furthermore, I gained insights into the importance of indices, both clustered and non-clustered, in optimizing query performance. Understanding these advanced database techniques equips me with the skills to handle complex data scenarios and improve the efficiency of database operations.

**[Database Programmability and Transactions](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/MySQL/tree/main/MYSQL/Lesson07_DatabaseProgrammabilityAndTransactions)**: In this section, I delved into the realm of database programmability and transaction management, essential for enhancing the functionality and reliability of database systems. I learned about user-defined functions, which allow for custom logic implementation within the database, improving code modularity and reusability. Additionally, I explored stored procedures, enabling the encapsulation of complex SQL logic for streamlined execution and enhanced security. Understanding transactions, I grasped the concept of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID), crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring the reliability of database operations. Furthermore, I gained insights into triggers, which automate actions based on predefined database events, enhancing data consistency and enforcing business rules. This comprehensive understanding of database programmability and transaction management equips me with the skills to develop robust and efficient database solutions capable of meeting diverse business requirements.

*In this [MySQL Course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/4365/mysql-january-2024), I've learned the basics of database management with a focus on SQL queries and CRUD operations. Additionally, I explored built-in functions for data manipulation, data aggregation techniques, table relations, advanced querying with JOINs and subqueries, and database programmability with user-defined functions, stored procedures, transactions, and triggers. This comprehensive training equips me to proficiently design, manage, and optimize databases for real-world applications.*
